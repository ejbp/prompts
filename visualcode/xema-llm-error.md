 I want you to analyse these errors and see if in a robust and scalable way (robust means that you are not adding if after if for each use case) we can mitigate/fix these problems. No problem if you do breaking changes or a big refactor (we didn't launch the app yet). Think Hard before doing anything. Then create a Plan and write it to docs/PLAN.md

If on the other side, the problem is the llm that is week, then we cannot do nothing.
